# MDX Vacuum for Astro

If you have used [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) before, you might have noticed that MDX files tend to become quite technical.

For us tech nerds, that is mostly fine, and being able to write the content into our technical documents in Markdown is already a big gain. But for non-tech content-editors, writing this style of markdown is quite a burden, and actually I realized, that it is quite a burden for my mind, too.

> I like my content to be clean, so I decided to _dust off my MDX_.

With the arrival of [Astro v1.0](https://astro.build)üöÄ and it's [MDX Integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/), there was the chance to implement a publication pipeline that provides content-editors with the ability to write almost clean markdown, with only a few sprinkles of JSX and without overloading the frontmatter: **MDX Vacuum for Astro** was born\*

\*previously called [`astro-m2dx`](https://astro-m2dx.netlify.app) - "Magic MDX"

MDX Vacuum is a [set of Vite, Remark and Rehype plugins](#the-plugins), that you can use in your Astro site generator, to keep your MDX as clean as you like.

<Claim>Dear Astronauts, take your vacuum cleaner and dust off your MDX!</Claim>

## The web site

Besides the plugins, the sources of the 'MDX Vacuum' web site are published as a showcase of how to apply the plugins to a file/git-based publication workflow. The source for the MDX Vacuum web site can be found in [`apps/web`](https://github.com/mdxvac/mdxvac/tree/main/apps/web).

## The plugins

The plugins can be found in [`packages/plugins/*`](https://github.com/mdxvac/mdxvac/tree/main/packages/plugins) and will be published to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/mdxvac)
